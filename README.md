See the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for a summary of changes.

## Installation

Users should pip install to a suitable environment using

```bash
$> pip install  git+https://github.com/ParaConUK/cohobj.git
```

This will install into the standard library.

Developers should fork then clone the repository (please create a branch before making 
any changes!), open a terminal window and activate the python environment 
required, cd to the cohobj directory and

```bash
$> pip install -e .
```

This will install as if into the standard library but using the cloned code 
which can be edited. Please commit code improvements and discuss merging with 
the master branch with Peter Clark and other users.
